The Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM) workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 9th edition of STACOM workshop will be held on 16 September 2018 at the [MICCAI 2018](http://www.miccai2018.org/) in Granada, Spain. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.

## Challenges

STACOM 2018 is running two exciting challenges:

### Atrial Segmentation

![]({{ "images/Cavity-Main-Figure-1-1-768x553.png" | relative_url }})

We provide 45 multi-sequence CMR images from patients who underwent cardiomyopathy. Each patient had been scanned using the three CMR sequences, i.e. the LGE, T2 and bSSFP. The task of this challenge is to segment the ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR, combing with other two sequences (T2 and bSSFP) from same patients, which can be used to assist the LGE CMR segmentation.

### LV Full Quantification Challenge

The aim of this challenge is to focus on full quantification of LV, i.e., all clinical significant LV indices regarding to the anatomical structure of LV are investigated in addition to the frequently studied LV volume, provide a unified platform for participants around the world to develop effective solutions for LV full quantification, and benchmark all submitted solutions for the task of LV quantification and advance the state-of-art performance for computer-aided cardiac image quantification.
